Versioning
==========

[Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/) is used as the versioning system with the following addendum.

If minor component is "even" it is considered *stable* and will not introduce breaking API changes in between patch files.  If it is "odd" then it is considered *unstable* the API may break and change in between patch levels, but is still API compatible with the most recent even minor version.
